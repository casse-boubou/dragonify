# Dragonify

This is a small utility for TrueNAS SCALE 24.10 (Electric Eel) which configures the Docker networking for TrueNAS-managed apps to allow them to communicate with each other, as was in 24.04 (Dragonfish). It will also add a DNS alias in the format `{service}.ix-{app-name}.svc.cluster.local` for each service to ensure backward-compatibility with the old Kubernetes-based apps system.

It's a stop-gap until inter-app networking is [properly implemented in Fangtooth](https://forums.truenas.com/t/inter-app-communication-in-24-10-electric-eel/22054).

## Installation

1. Go to "Apps" in the TrueNAS SCALE web UI.
2. Click "Discover Apps".
3. Click **â‹®** in the top-right corner, then "Install via YAML".
4. Set the name to `dragonify`, and paste the following YAML into the text box.

```yaml
services:
  dragonify:
    image: ghcr.io/tjhorner/dragonify:main
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Once started, all of your apps will now be connected on the same Docker network with DNS aliases for each service.

## Technical Details

To facilitate inter-app communication, Dragonify creates a new Docker bridge network called `apps-internal`. It connects all existing TrueNAS-managed containers to the network, then starts listening for new containers to be started. When a new container is started, Dragonify will automatically connect it to the `apps-internal` network.

It is essentially running this command automatically for you (using postgres as an example):

```sh
docker network connect apps-internal --alias postgres.ix-postgres.svc.cluster.local ix-postgres-postgres-1
```
